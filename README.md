# MAMR, OLMAR, and PAMR simulations for binance exchange
Implementation of PAMR and MAMR portfolio management algorithms for online portfolio management and analysis of cryptocurrency assets.

### MAMR and PAMR Simulations
The scripts `MAMR.py` and `PAMR.py` simulate the returns that the portfolio selection algorithms would have achived had the algorithm been running. We see that MAMR outperforms PAMR in general, although parameter fitting has only been done by eye - no system has been implemented (yet). The MAMR implementation differes slightly from the paper by using a different moving average for the return prediction which empirically enjoys better results.

#### PAMR 30 minute Performance - with the trading fee of 0.1%

### Requirements
	pip3 install requests numpy scipy  

### Binance Trading Bot
Create a file `keys.py` and assign the api key and secret key from a binance account to the variables `api` and `secret` respectively in the `keys.py` file. When the bot runs it gets the spot portfolio of the tracked currencies (currencies in the CURRENCIES variable) and runs the MAMR algorithm to calculate the next portfolio and then makes the trade in a way that minimises the trade volume to reduce fees. The state, along with the market data is then pickled and is opened on the next run. The parameters in the implementation expect the script to be run every 12 hours. 

### To run PAMR/MAMR simulations
	git clone https://github.com/alfredholmes/Binance-Portfolio-Management.git
	cd Binance-Portfolio-Management
	python3 data/get_candles_spot.py 
	python3 PAMR.py
	python3 MAMR.py

In general MAMR outperforms PAMR for cryptocurrency portfolios.
